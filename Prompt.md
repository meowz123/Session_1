What I want in the UI:

   - user / assistant message bubbles
   - markdown rendering
   - code blocks with copy button
   - streaming responses
   - typing / thinking state
   - retry, edit, regenerate actions
   - timestamps

2. Agentic workflow features
   - show tool calls in-line
   - expandable reasoning / status steps
   - task progress states like:

     - searching
     - using tool
     - waiting
     - completed
     - failed
   - allow multi-step execution visibility
   - show citations / sources
   - show attachments and generated artifacts

3. Composer area
   - multiline prompt input
   - file upload
   - microphone button placeholder
   - send button
   - model / mode selector
   - agent mode toggle

4. Sidebar
